# Setup
Your goal will be to clone an existing website/app (in other words, create a copy/your own version from scratch).

This is a great opportunity to gain experience working together as a team (which is one of the hardest parts of coding). Focus on working together, collaborating, and getting practice before your final Capstone projects.

This will also be a portfolio project. Focus on completing your MVP and writing good, clean code!

# Responsibilities
Each group member must choose at least ONE feature, and create everything for that feature (including backend, fronted, and design).

During job interviews, most interviewers will ask you about your projects. The next question is almost always 'which part of the project did you do?' Make sure you have a good answer!

# Demos
You will be presenting your project to the class on **Thursday 1/12** (we will start reviewing for the final exam on that Friday)
.
You will be also doing a practice demo on **Monday 1/9**.

# Scaffold
To get started, clone the following scaffold: https://github.com/C4Q/access-code-generator

Use this as a starting point for your app

# Roadmap:
1. Create a proposal for an MVP for your project. You will need to get this proposal approved by Nate/Charles before you start. Your proposal should include:
  - Database plan (what models you will need)
  - API Routes (list out what endpoints you will need)
  - wireframes/mockup/sketch of your UI
1. Setup a shared github repo for your project
1. Create a waffle.io board for the project and plan out your first sprint
1. Assign features to each group member
1. Write API tests for your feature (using mocha/chai). Do this BEFORE you start any other coding
1. Create the backend
1. Create the fronted
1. Add design. Do not start on any css/design until your backend and fronted are COMPLETELY done
